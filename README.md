## Scraper 
**(a blockchain based waste-management system)**

****OVERVIEW****
Scraper is a blockchain based solution to the present problem of waste disposal without treatment.The platform atmomates and collects the waste produced in the household by the concerned authority whcih in turn pass the considerable  amount(garbage) to the selected Company which recycles the waste and this whole process is securely insured without any faulty activity via supply-chain solution of blockchain.

**Flaws based on stats-**
1.  About 20% of garbage is not collected from household and add up to littering of nearby.
    
2.  From the collected garbage only 30% is treated to recycle.Rest is dumped or burned.

## **Working Model**

## Steps Involved:

Step-1

Waste generator posts a requestes about the waste collected by him on the decentralized-platform in order to get incentivized.

Step-2

Once a considerable amount of waste is generated from a particular place.Through use of supply chain the concerned authority gets notified to send the garbage-collection-vehicle to collect the garbage.

Step-3

The authority after gaining a considerable amount of that particular type of waste notifies and transports the waste to the company tenderised to collect the recycle the collected waste.

Step-4

Once the whole process is complete participant of the supply chain or any certified(permitted)person can access the secure,correct,immutable data collected on blockchain and ensure sustainable use of the waste.

**Important Note-**
1) A centralized server based platform for waste-management this is only for present use and every aspect of the platform has to replaced by a decentralized blockchain based platform.
1) A decentralized blockchain based futuristic model of handling waste.

----------------------
###  Technology -Stack Used

         Node.js, Mongodb,Blockchain, Javascript(ES6), Templating-engine(HBS),HTML, CSS
  
 
### Advantages of the present platform-

1)Totally Transparent and proof based garbage collection system.

2)Data collected is 100% true and so without wasting huge money on surveys can serve as a database for taking actions and making policies.

3)Standard incentivisation system can be introduced for the waste generators(future prospect)

4)Automation leading to less delay and effective utilization of vehicles and storage places for Cost-Reduction.

## **How to start the project**

### 1) Blockchain-based app
			

 - cd to [2.Blockchain_baised-scrapper](https://github.com/sudonitesh/runio/tree/master/2.Blockchain_baised-scrapper "2.Blockchain_baised-scrapper")
- npm install
- Install matamask(crome extention) and set the test-rpc to [http://127.0.0.1:8545](http://127.0.0.1:8545)
- open another comand prompt come to the repo and- “ganache-cli” for starting the blockahin on the same port as above.
- Inside another CMD “truffle migrate”
- npm run dev

### 2) Non-Blockchain-based app
- cd to [non-blockchain_scraper-web-app](https://github.com/sudonitesh/runio/tree/master/non-blockchain_scraper-web-app "non-blockchain_scraper-web-app")
- npm i
- node app.js
